# Company Project: Workout more ‚Äì support your local youth sports club!

The collaboration partner for this project is [Svenska Spel](https://karriar.svenskaspel.se/)! Each year, Svenska Spel gives away 50 million kronor to youth sports clubs all around the country. As a Svenska Spel player you get to vote on how the distribution between the clubs should be divided. This initiative is called [Gr√§sroten](https://www.svenskaspel.se/grasroten). In this project we will do our own version of Gr√§sroten, not based on voting but on physical activity.

In this project we built a React app that both encourages you to be more active and raise money for local youth sports club. We built a ‚ÄúWorkout tracker‚Äù that collects points for physical activity. We use Svenska Spels internal API to search youth clubs around Sweden. By being physical active you collect points to that team which by the end of the year will be translated into money - or at least we wish it to be ;) 

We also included a form of gamification‚Äîsomething to make the user feel good for completing a goal, and something to make them keep coming back and using the app.

Finally we build a statistics page which shows how many exercies have been completed per week, and renders some charts to practice using data viz libraries. 

### Tech Specifications

The project was built in React and SASS and utilised the Nivo data visualisation library.

Svenska Spel wrote a short doumentation on how you access it and how to use the API. [Go to Svenska Spel API.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iyHJyfBIRDoCiib3lL4Mq61rIZ_u-NYINWYNaFKPIjE/edit?usp=sharing)

Package the app as a Chrome extension, or make it run as an electron app.
